... or RAT for short, for when you're ready to join the rat race of applying to jobs.

This tool is for compiling job post descriptions, skills, etc in one place for refining your resume since it's good practice to tailor your resume language to target jobs.

RAT lets you enter in job information and then displays all saved jobs in an easy to read grid. Most job postings have lots of garbage text and filler content, so this app is meant for you to aggregate only relevant information.

This project was born from my frustation of having two thousand tabs open of prospective jobs when updating my resume.

Frontend built in Angular and backend in .NET. Data is saved as JSON inside the project folders.

## Possible future implementations

-   Job scraping functionality:

    -   Planning on experimenting with web scraping to auto pull information from postings. This is difficult to do with sites lik indeed and linkedin, but entirely possible for smaller job sites/city gov sites.

-   Add markdown editor for saving jobs. This would overall improve the display and readability of saved jobs.
